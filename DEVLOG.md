# BlitzNext Developer Log

## v0.2.7 - "Color & Pixel Primitives" (2026-02-23)

### Milestone 40: Color & Pixel Primitives

- **`bb_graphics2d.h` extended** — colour/pixel API appended after the M39 buffer/flip section

- **Draw colour state** — `bb_draw_r_/g_/b_` (`Uint8`, all 255 = white, matching Blitz3D's startup default); separate from the clear colour (`bb_cls_r_/g_/b_`, declared in M39)

- **`bb_Color(r, g, b)`** — stores clamped (0–255) values into `bb_draw_r_/g_/b_`; does not repaint anything already on screen

- **`bb_ClsColor(r, g, b)`** — updates `bb_cls_r_/g_/b_`; takes effect on the next `Cls()` call

- **`bb_ColorRed/Green/Blue()`** — return the three draw-colour bytes as `int`; pure state reads with no SDL side-effect

- **`bb_GetColor(x, y)`**:
  - Headless guard: returns 0 when `bb_renderer_` is null
  - `SDL_RenderReadPixels(renderer, &rect{x,y,1,1})` → `SDL_Surface*`
  - `SDL_ReadSurfacePixel(surf, 0, 0, &r, &g, &b, &a)` extracts RGBA bytes
  - `SDL_DestroySurface(surf)` frees the temporary surface
  - Overwrites `bb_draw_r_/g_/b_` so `ColorRed/Green/Blue()` immediately reflect the sampled pixel

- **`bb_Plot(x, y)`**:
  - Headless guard: no-op when `bb_renderer_` is null
  - `SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(renderer, bb_draw_r_, bb_draw_g_, bb_draw_b_, 255)`
  - `SDL_RenderPoint(renderer, (float)x, (float)y)`

- **`blitzcc.cpp`**: 7 new entries in `kCommands[]` (Color, ClsColor, ColorRed, ColorGreen, ColorBlue, GetColor, Plot); version bumped to v0.2.7

### Design Notes
`bb_draw_r_/g_/b_` defaults to white (255,255,255) to match Blitz3D behaviour where new programs draw white on a black background until `Color` is called. Separating draw colour from clear colour (introduced in M39) means `ClsColor` and `Color` can be set independently without interfering with each other. `GetColor` rewrites the draw-colour state rather than returning a packed integer — this matches Blitz3D's API where the caller reads back components via `ColorRed/Green/Blue`. `SDL_ReadSurfacePixel` is an SDL3-only function; no SDL2 equivalent. Clamping in `bb_Color` / `bb_ClsColor` mirrors Blitz3D: out-of-range values are silently clamped rather than raising an error.

### Verification (`tests/test_m40_color.bb`)
- `Color 200,100,50` → `ColorRed=200`, `ColorGreen=100`, `ColorBlue=50` ✓
- `ClsColor 10,20,30 : Cls` → `ClsColor OK`, `Cls OK` ✓ (no-op headless)
- `Color 300,-5,128` → clamped to `255/0/128` ✓
- `Plot 100,100` → `Plot OK` ✓ (no-op headless)
- `GetColor 100,100` → `GetColor OK` ✓ (no-op headless; draw colour unchanged)
- `DONE` ✓

---

## v0.2.6 - "Buffer & Flip" (2026-02-23)

### Milestone 39: Buffer & Flip

- **`bb_graphics2d.h` extended** — buffer/flip API added after the M38 graphics init section; `bb_runtime.h` already includes this file

- **Buffer handle constants**:
  - `BB_BACK_BUFFER_H = 1`, `BB_FRONT_BUFFER_H = 2` — integer tokens that match Blitz3D's `BackBuffer()` / `FrontBuffer()` return values
  - `bb_active_buffer_` — tracks the currently set buffer (default: back)

- **Clear color state** — `bb_cls_r_/g_/b_` (`Uint8`, all 0 = black) reserved for `ClsColor` (M40); declared here so M39's `Cls` uses them immediately

- **`bb_BackBuffer()`** → returns `BB_BACK_BUFFER_H` (1)

- **`bb_FrontBuffer()`** → returns `BB_FRONT_BUFFER_H` (2)

- **`bb_SetBuffer(buf)`** → stores in `bb_active_buffer_`; no renderer action needed (SDL3 always renders to the back buffer internally)

- **`bb_Cls()`**:
  - No-op when `bb_renderer_` is null (headless safe)
  - `SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(renderer, bb_cls_r_, bb_cls_g_, bb_cls_b_, 255)` then `SDL_RenderClear(renderer)`
  - Color sourced from `bb_cls_r_/g_/b_` so `ClsColor` (M40) takes effect immediately

- **`bb_Flip(vblank=1)`**:
  - No-op when `bb_renderer_` is null
  - `SDL_RenderPresent(renderer)` — swaps back/front buffers
  - Calls `bb_PollEvents()` to drain SDL events after every present; prevents window-not-responding freeze in game loops that only call `Flip`, not an explicit event pump
  - `vblank` accepted for API parity, not acted upon (SDL3 vsync is set at renderer creation)

- **`bb_CopyRect(sx, sy, sw, sh, dx, dy, srcbuf, dstbuf)`** — silent stub; compile-safe; full implementation deferred to M46 (render-to-texture)

- **`blitzcc.cpp`**: 6 new entries in `kCommands[]` (BackBuffer, FrontBuffer, SetBuffer, Cls, Flip, CopyRect); version bumped to v0.2.6

### Design Notes
SDL3's renderer always draws to an internal back buffer; `SDL_RenderPresent` is the flip. Blitz3D's `SetBuffer BackBuffer()` / `SetBuffer FrontBuffer()` are therefore bookkeeping only — the active buffer token is stored for programs that query it but has no effect on where SDL renders. `Flip` pumping `bb_PollEvents()` is essential: Blitz3D programs typically have `Flip` at the end of their game loop and nothing else that would drain the OS event queue; without the pump the window would become unresponsive within seconds.

### Verification (`tests/test_m39_buffer.bb`)
- `BackBuffer()` → `1` ✓
- `FrontBuffer()` → `2` ✓
- `SetBuffer BackBuffer()` → `SetBuffer OK` ✓
- `Cls` → `Cls OK` ✓ (no-op headless)
- `Flip` → `Flip OK` ✓ (no-op headless)
- `Flip 0` → `Flip 0 OK` ✓
- `CopyRect 0,0,100,100,200,200` → `CopyRect OK` ✓
- `DONE` ✓

---

## v0.2.5 - "Graphics Mode Init" (2026-02-23)

### Milestone 38: Graphics Mode Init

- **`bb_graphics2d.h` (new file)** — 2D graphics foundation; `bb_runtime.h` includes it after `bb_sound3d.h`

- **Global display state** — four inline ints `bb_gfx_width_`, `bb_gfx_height_`, `bb_gfx_depth_`, `bb_gfx_rate_` store the active display parameters; set unconditionally by `bb_Graphics()` so query functions work even on headless machines

- **`bb_Graphics(w, h, depth, mode)`**:
  - Calls `bb_sdl_ensure_()` then tears down any existing window/renderer before creating new ones
  - mode 0: windowed (`SDL_WindowFlags = 0`)
  - mode 1 / 6: fullscreen (`SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN`); mode 6 also enables vsync via `SDL_SetRenderVSync`
  - mode 2: fullscreen-desktop — queries primary display via `SDL_GetCurrentDisplayMode` and overrides `w/h` with desktop size
  - `SDL_CreateWindow(title, w, h, flags)` — title sourced from `bb_app_title_` (set by `AppTitle`), defaults to `"BlitzNext"`
  - `SDL_CreateRenderer(window, nullptr)` — uses SDL3's default hardware renderer
  - Refresh rate queried post-creation via `SDL_GetDisplayForWindow` + `SDL_GetCurrentDisplayMode`; stored in `bb_gfx_rate_`
  - Silent on headless machines (SDL init failure or display unavailable)

- **`bb_EndGraphics()`** — destroys renderer then window; zeros all `bb_gfx_*` state; idempotent

- **Query functions** — `bb_GraphicsWidth/Height/Depth/Rate()` return the stored `bb_gfx_*` values

- **Memory stubs** — `bb_TotalVidMem()` / `bb_AvailVidMem()` return `512 * 1024 * 1024` (512 MB); SDL3 exposes no VRAM query API; value is large enough that BB programs checking available VRAM before loading assets always proceed

- **`bb_GraphicsMode(w, h, depth, rate)`** — re-enters Graphics at a different resolution; `rate` accepted for API parity, not used; delegates to `bb_Graphics(w, h, depth, 0)`

- **`blitzcc.cpp`**: 9 new entries in `kCommands[]` (Graphics, EndGraphics, GraphicsWidth, GraphicsHeight, GraphicsDepth, GraphicsRate, TotalVidMem, AvailVidMem, GraphicsMode); version bumped to v0.2.5

### Design Notes
`bb_Graphics()` stores requested dimensions before calling `bb_sdl_ensure_()`, so `GraphicsWidth()`/`GraphicsHeight()` always return sane values even when SDL fails to open a window (headless CI, no display). The `AppTitle` integration means calling `AppTitle "Game"` before `Graphics 800,600` correctly sets the window title. SDL3 `SDL_CreateRenderer` selects the best available hardware backend automatically; no flags are needed.

### Verification (`tests/test_m38_graphics.bb`)
- `GraphicsWidth()` → `800` ✓
- `GraphicsHeight()` → `600` ✓
- `GraphicsDepth()` → `32` ✓
- `GraphicsRate OK` ✓ (non-zero on a real display)
- `TotalVidMem OK` ✓ (512 MB stub)
- `AvailVidMem OK` ✓
- `GraphicsMode 640,480,32,0` → no crash ✓
- `EndGraphics OK` ✓
- `DONE` ✓

### Post-M38 Bug Fixes (v0.2.5 patch)

**Bug 1 — `AppTitle` does not update a live window title** *(`bb_system.h`, `bb_graphics2d.h`)*
`bb_AppTitle()` only stored the string; calling it after `Graphics()` left the OS window title unchanged.
Fix: added `bb_title_update_hook_` callback (same pattern as `bb_audio_update_hook_`). `bb_graphics2d.h` registers `bb_update_window_title_()` which calls `SDL_SetWindowTitle(bb_window_, title)` whenever a window is open.

**Bug 2 — `WaitKey` ignores the window when launched without a console** *(`bb_sdl.h`)*
When a Blitz3D program is launched by double-click or from an IDE (no console, but window open), `bb_stdin_is_console_()` returned false and `WaitKey` returned immediately — the window closed before the user could see it.
Fix: `bb_WaitKey()` now checks `bb_window_ != nullptr` first. When a window is open it always blocks on `SDL_WaitEvent`, regardless of stdin state.

**Bug 3 — `bb_stdin_is_console_()` treats Windows NUL as a real console** *(`bb_sdl.h`)*
`GetFileType()` returns `FILE_TYPE_CHAR` for both real consoles and the Windows `NUL` device (`/dev/null`). This caused test programs with `WaitKey` (e.g. `test_fixes.bb`) to block forever when run as `test.exe < /dev/null`.
Fix: replaced `GetFileType` with `GetConsoleMode` — it succeeds only for genuine interactive console handles and fails for `NUL`, pipes, and file redirections.

## v0.2.4 - "3D Sound" (2026-02-23)

### Milestone 37: 3D / Positional Sound

- **`bb_sound3d.h` (new file)** — 3D audio state layer on top of `bb_sound.h`; `bb_runtime.h` includes it after `bb_sound.h`

- **`bb_Load3DSound(file)`** — thin wrapper over `bb_LoadSound`; the returned handle works with `PlaySound`/`LoopSound` and is then positioned via `Channel3DPosition`. No separate sound bank needed.

- **Per-sound falloff: `bb_SoundRange(snd, inner, outer)`** — stores the full-volume inner radius and silence outer radius in `bb_snd3d_inner_[snd]` / `bb_snd3d_outer_[snd]`. Not applied at runtime yet; reserved for a future distance-attenuation pass.

- **Per-channel 3D state**:
  - `bb_Channel3DPosition(ch, x, y, z)` — stores world-space position in `bb_snd_chan3d_[ch]`
  - `bb_Channel3DVelocity(ch, vx, vy, vz)` — stores Doppler velocity (stub; stored only)
  - `bb_Chan3D_` struct added: `{x, y, z, vx, vy, vz}` with float defaults

- **Listener state** (global; one listener per program):
  - `bb_ListenerPosition(x, y, z)` → `bb_snd3d_lx_/y_/z_`
  - `bb_ListenerOrientation(fx, fy, fz, ux, uy, uz)` → forward + up vectors; default `-Z` forward, `+Y` up
  - `bb_ListenerVelocity(vx, vy, vz)` → Doppler velocity (stored)

- **`bb_WaitSound(ch)`** — blocks until `bb_ChannelPlaying(ch)` returns 0; polls every 10 ms via `SDL_Delay` + `bb_snd_update_()` so one-shot cleanup runs correctly. `ch=0` (or finished channel) returns immediately.

- **C++ aliases for digit-prefixed BB commands**:
  - `bb_3DSoundVolume(snd, vol)` → `bb_SoundVolume`
  - `bb_3DSoundPan(snd, pan)` → `bb_SoundPan`
  - `bb_3DChannelVolume(ch, vol)` → `bb_ChannelVolume`
  - `bb_3DChannelPan(ch, pan)` → `bb_ChannelPan`
  - BB-level exposure of `3D`-prefixed names requires a lexer extension (identifiers cannot start with a digit); deferred.

- **`blitzcc.cpp`**: 8 new entries in `kCommands[]` (Load3DSound, SoundRange, Channel3DPosition, Channel3DVelocity, ListenerPosition, ListenerOrientation, ListenerVelocity, WaitSound); version bumped to v0.2.4

### Design Notes
SDL3 has no native positional audio API. All 3D state (position, velocity, orientation) is stored in inline globals/arrays for forward compatibility. A future milestone can compute distance-based gain and stereo pan from listener↔source geometry and write the results via `SDL_SetAudioStreamGain` and a manual stereo-pan mixing pass. `WaitSound` deliberately uses `bb_snd_update_()` rather than sleeping blindly so that one-shot channels are cleaned up on schedule and looping channels continue to refill.

### Verification (`tests/test_m37_sound3d.bb`)
- `Load3DSound("boom.wav")` → `0` ✓ (headless / no file)
- `SoundRange 0, 1.0, 10.0` → safe no-op (snd=0 guard) ✓
- `WaitSound 0` → immediate return ✓
- `Channel3DPosition 0, …` / `Channel3DVelocity 0, …` → no crash ✓
- `ListenerPosition` / `ListenerOrientation` / `ListenerVelocity` → no crash ✓
- `DONE` ✓

---

## v0.2.3 - "Music & CD" (2026-02-23)

### Milestone 36: Music & CD

- **`bb_sound.h` extended**:
  - `bb_snd_music_snd_` / `bb_snd_music_ch_` — global slots tracking the active music track
  - `bb_PlayMusic(file)` — stops current music, loads WAV via `bb_LoadSound` + `bb_LoopSound`; returns channel handle; OGG/MP3 fail gracefully (SDL3 only handles WAV natively)
  - `bb_StopMusic()` — `bb_StopChannel(music_ch)` + `bb_FreeSound(music_snd)`; resets both globals to 0
  - `bb_MusicPlaying()` — delegates to `bb_ChannelPlaying(music_ch)`; auto-clears globals when channel finishes
  - `bb_PlayCDTrack(track)` — stub; logs `[runtime] PlayCDTrack: CD audio is not supported` to stderr; returns immediately
- **`blitzcc.cpp`**: 4 music entries added to `kCommands[]`; version bumped to v0.2.3
- **Test:** `tests/test_m36_music.bb` — headless: `PlayMusic` → 0 (no file/device), `MusicPlaying` → 0, `StopMusic` → no-op, `PlayCDTrack 1` → warning on stderr

---

## v0.2.2 - "Channel Control" (2026-02-23)

### Milestone 35: Channel Control

- **`bb_sound.h` extended**:
  - `bb_Sound_` gains `vol=1.0f`, `pan=0.0f`, `pitch=0.0f` — defaults propagated to new channels in `bb_play_sound_()`
  - `bb_Channel_` gains `paused=false`, `gain=1.0f`, `pan=0.0f` — tracks runtime per-channel state
  - `bb_play_sound_()` now calls `SDL_SetAudioStreamGain(s, vol)` and `SDL_SetAudioStreamFrequencyRatio(s, pitch/orig_freq)` when sound has non-default values; stores `gain`/`pan` in the new channel slot
  - `bb_snd_update_()` skips channels with `paused=true` (no refill, no cleanup while paused)

- **`bb_PauseChannel(ch)`** — `SDL_UnbindAudioStream`; `paused = true`; data remains in stream buffer, no data is consumed while unbound
- **`bb_ResumeChannel(ch)`** — `SDL_BindAudioStream(bb_snd_dev_, stream)`; `paused = false`; continues from buffer position (no seek needed)
- **`bb_ChannelPlaying(ch)`** — returns `stream != nullptr`; returns 1 for paused channels (they're still alive), 0 when slot is empty (finished one-shot or manually stopped)
- **`bb_ChannelVolume(ch, vol)`** — stores in `gain`; calls `SDL_SetAudioStreamGain` (skipped when paused, gain restored on resume isn't automatic — caller must re-set if needed)
- **`bb_ChannelPan(ch, pan)`** — stored in `pan` field; SDL3 has no per-stream stereo pan natively; full implementation deferred to audio-processing milestone
- **`bb_ChannelPitch(ch, hz)`** — `SDL_SetAudioStreamFrequencyRatio(stream, hz / src_spec.freq)`; resampling handled by SDL3 internally
- **`bb_SoundVolume/Pan/Pitch(snd, …)`** — set defaults on `bb_Sound_`; applied when `bb_PlaySound`/`bb_LoopSound` creates a new channel
- **`blitzcc.cpp`**: 9 channel-control entries added to `kCommands[]`

### Design Notes
Pause/resume via unbind/rebind is cleaner than gain=0 (gain=0 still lets SDL consume data, causing a paused one-shot to drain silently). Unbound streams preserve their queued data in the stream's internal buffer — rebinding resumes from the exact position. `ChannelVolume` during pause stores the gain but does not call `SDL_SetAudioStreamGain` (there's no stream bound to update); the gain is reapplied by the caller via `ChannelVolume` after `ResumeChannel` if needed.

### Verification (`tests/test_m35_channel.bb`)
- All 9 API functions: OK ✓
- `ChannelPlaying(0)` → `0` ✓
- `DONE` ✓

---

## v0.2.1 - "Sound Loading & Playback" (2026-02-23)

### Milestone 34: Sound Loading & Playback

- **`bb_sound.h` (new file)** — complete SDL3 audio system:
  - `bb_snd_dev_` (`SDL_AudioDeviceID`) + `bb_snd_spec_` — lazy audio device; opened with `SDL_OpenAudioDevice(SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK, nullptr)`; device format retrieved via `SDL_GetAudioDeviceFormat`
  - `bb_snd_ensure_()` — calls `bb_sdl_ensure_()` then `SDL_InitSubSystem(SDL_INIT_AUDIO)` and opens the device; separate from graphics init so text-mode + graphics-only programs pay zero audio overhead
  - `bb_snd_quit_()` — unbinds+destroys all streams, SDL_frees all sound buffers, closes device, calls `SDL_QuitSubSystem(SDL_INIT_AUDIO)`
  - `bb_Sound_{data, len, spec}` — 64-slot bank; slots 1–63 used; data is SDL-allocated PCM
  - `bb_Channel_{stream, snd_id, looping}` — 32-slot bank; slots 1–31 used
  - `bb_LoadSound(file)` — `SDL_LoadWAV` → fills next free `bb_snd_sounds_` slot; returns 1-based handle
  - `bb_FreeSound(handle)` — stops dependent channels; `SDL_free`; zeros slot
  - `bb_play_sound_(snd, loop)` — internal: reuses finished one-shot slots; `SDL_CreateAudioStream(src_spec, device_spec)` + `SDL_BindAudioStream` + `SDL_PutAudioStreamData`; flushes if one-shot
  - `bb_PlaySound(snd)` → `bb_play_sound_(snd, false)` (flush = one-shot)
  - `bb_LoopSound(snd)` → `bb_play_sound_(snd, true)` (no flush = kept alive by refill)
  - `bb_StopChannel(ch)` — `SDL_UnbindAudioStream` + `SDL_DestroyAudioStream`; zeros slot
  - `bb_snd_update_()` — looping: refills when `SDL_GetAudioStreamQueued < sound_len`; one-shot: auto-destroys when queued == 0
  - `bb_snd_hook_reg_` — `inline const bool` that registers `bb_snd_update_` as `bb_audio_update_hook_` at startup (before main)

- **`bb_sdl.h` extended**:
  - `bb_audio_update_hook_` — `inline void (*)() = nullptr`; called by `bb_PollEvents()` after every SDL event drain; zero cost when audio not in use

- **`bb_runtime.h` updated**:
  - `#include "bb_sound.h"` added after bb_input.h
  - `bbEnd()` now calls `bb_snd_quit_()` before `bb_sdl_quit_()` to ensure audio teardown in correct order

- **`blitzcc.cpp`**: 5 sound entries added to `kCommands[]` (LoadSound, FreeSound, PlaySound, LoopSound, StopChannel)

### Design Notes
Audio uses SDL3 audio streams — one `SDL_AudioStream` per active channel, all bound to the same `SDL_AudioDeviceID`. SDL3 mixes bound streams automatically. Each stream is created with the sound's native format as source and the device's format as destination; SDL3 handles sample-rate conversion and format conversion transparently. Looping relies on periodic refill via `bb_PollEvents()` hook rather than a dedicated audio thread, which keeps the implementation simple and single-threaded.

### Verification (`tests/test_m34_sound.bb`)
- `LoadSound("beep.wav")` → `0` ✓ (no audio device in headless mode)
- `PlaySound(0)` → `0` ✓ (null handle → no-op)
- `StopChannel(0)` → no crash ✓
- `FreeSound(0)` → no crash ✓
- `DONE` ✓

---

## v0.2.0 - "Joystick Input" (2026-02-23)

### Milestone 33: Joystick Input

- **`bb_sdl.h` extended**:
  - `BB_JOY_MAX_PORTS=4`, `BB_JOY_MAX_BUTTONS=32`, `BB_JOY_BTN_QUEUE_CAP=8`
  - `bb_JoyPort_` struct — `handle`, `id`, `is_gamepad`; axes `x/y/z/u/v` (float -1..1); `hat` (int 0–8); `btn_down[32]`, `btn_hit[32]` (bool arrays); `btn_queue[8]` FIFO
  - `bb_joy_[4]` inline array of ports
  - `bb_joy_find_port_(SDL_JoystickID)` — O(4) scan returning port index or -1
  - `bb_sdl_hat_to_blitz_(Uint8)` — converts SDL bitmask hat → Blitz3D direction (switch on 9 values)
  - `bb_sdl_ensure_()` now inits `SDL_INIT_JOYSTICK | SDL_INIT_GAMEPAD` in addition to VIDEO/EVENTS
  - `bb_sdl_quit_()` closes all open joystick handles before SDL_Quit
  - `bb_sdl_process_event_()` extended: JOYSTICK_ADDED → open + fill port; JOYSTICK_REMOVED → close + zero port; AXIS_MOTION → normalize Sint16 to -1..1, map axis 0-4; HAT_MOTION → convert hat 0 only; BUTTON_DOWN → set held/hit, enqueue 1-based number; BUTTON_UP → clear held

- **`bb_input.h` extended** — joystick API:
  - `bb_JoyType(port)` → 0/1/2; pumps events then checks handle
  - `bb_JoyX/Y/Z/U/V(port)` → float; pumps + reads cached axis
  - `bb_JoyHat(port)` → int 0–8; pumps + reads cached hat
  - `bb_JoyDown(port, btn)` — 1-based; pumps, checks `btn_down[btn-1]`
  - `bb_JoyHit(port, btn)` — edge-triggered; reads+clears `btn_hit[btn-1]`
  - `bb_WaitJoy(port)` — ensures SDL, pumps, blocks via `SDL_WaitEvent` + `bb_sdl_process_event_()` until button FIFO non-empty; returns 1-based button
  - `bb_GetJoy(port)` — alias for `bb_WaitJoy`
  - `bb_FlushJoy(port)` — zeros held/hit arrays and FIFO; axis/hat preserved

- **`blitzcc.cpp`**: 12 joystick entries added to `kCommands[]`

### Design Note
All axis/hat/button state is event-driven (same pattern as keyboard/mouse). Headless programs (SDL not initialized) return 0/0.0f from all joystick queries with zero overhead. Axis normalization divides by 32767.0f and clamps to -1.0 (handles Sint16 minimum of -32768). Only hat 0 is tracked per port. WaitJoy correctly handles port-scoped queues separate from each other.

### Verification (`tests/test_m33_joystick.bb`)
- `JoyType(0)` → `0` ✓ (headless, no device)
- `JoyX(0)` → `0` ✓
- `JoyY(0)` → `0` ✓
- `JoyHat(0)` → `0` ✓
- `JoyDown(0,1)` → `0` ✓
- `JoyHit(0,1)` → `0` ✓
- `FlushJoy 0` → no crash ✓
- `DONE` ✓

---

## v0.1.9 - "Mouse Input" (2026-02-23)

### Milestone 32: Mouse Input

- **`bb_sdl.h` extended**:
  - `bb_mouse_x_`, `bb_mouse_y_` — cursor position (float; updated by MOUSE_MOTION)
  - `bb_mouse_z_` — scroll-wheel accumulator (positive = up; flipped direction normalised)
  - `bb_mouse_xrel_`, `bb_mouse_yrel_`, `bb_mouse_zrel_` — delta accumulators; reset on each speed read
  - `bb_mouse_down_[4]`, `bb_mouse_hit_[4]` — held/edge-triggered state (indices 1=left,2=right,3=middle)
  - `BB_MOUSE_QUEUE_CAP = 16`; `bb_mouse_queue_buf_[16]` FIFO of button numbers; `bb_mouse_queue_head_/tail_`
  - `bb_sdl_btn_to_blitz_(Uint8)` — maps SDL LEFT/RIGHT/MIDDLE → 1/2/3
  - `bb_sdl_process_event_()` extended: MOUSE_MOTION updates pos + xrel/yrel; BUTTON_DOWN sets hit/down + enqueues; BUTTON_UP clears down; MOUSE_WHEEL accumulates z/zrel

- **`bb_input.h` extended** — mouse API:
  - `bb_MouseX()`, `bb_MouseY()` — pump events, return `(int)bb_mouse_x_/y_`
  - `bb_MouseZ()` — pump events, return `(int)bb_mouse_z_`
  - `bb_MouseXSpeed()`, `bb_MouseYSpeed()`, `bb_MouseZSpeed()` — return int delta, reset accumulator to 0
  - `bb_MouseDown(btn)` — pump + read held flag; bounds-checked (1–3)
  - `bb_MouseHit(btn)` — pump + read+clear edge-triggered hit flag
  - `bb_WaitMouse()` — ensures SDL, pumps, blocks via `SDL_WaitEvent` + `bb_sdl_process_event_()` until queue non-empty; dequeues and returns button number
  - `bb_GetMouse()` — alias for `bb_WaitMouse()`
  - `bb_FlushMouse()` — zeros held/hit arrays, speed accumulators, queue head/tail; drains `SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_MOTION..MOUSE_WHEEL` via `SDL_FlushEvents`
  - `bb_MoveMouse(x,y)` — ensures SDL; `SDL_WarpMouseInWindow` when window exists, else `SDL_WarpMouseGlobal`

### Design Notes
All mouse functions pump SDL events before sampling (same pattern as keyboard), so game loops that poll `MouseDown` work without an explicit `PollEvents` call. In headless mode (`bb_sdl_initialized_ = false`) all positional and button queries return 0 with zero overhead. `bb_mouse_xrel_/yrel_/zrel_` accumulate between reads, so `MouseXSpeed()` correctly sums multiple motion events that fire within one game frame.

### Verification (`tests/test_m32_mouse.bb`)
- `MouseX()` → `0` ✓ (headless)
- `MouseY()` → `0` ✓
- `MouseZ()` → `0` ✓
- `MouseDown(1)` → `0` ✓
- `MouseHit(1)` → `0` ✓
- `FlushMouse` → no crash ✓
- `DONE` ✓

---

## v0.1.8 - "Keyboard Input" (2026-02-23)

### Milestone 31: Keyboard Input

- **`bb_input.h` (new file)** — keyboard API; `bb_runtime.h` includes it after `bb_sdl.h`
- **`bb_blitz_to_sdl_[256]`** — inline `std::array`; maps Blitz3D DIK code (1–255) → `SDL_Scancode`; covers full US QWERTY layout, F1–F12, numpad, cursor cluster, Home/End/PgUp/PgDn/Ins/Del, Win/App keys; built at startup with a lambda initializer
- **`bb_sdl_to_blitz_[512]`** — reverse map; inverted from `bb_blitz_to_sdl_` at startup; used by `bb_GetKey()` to convert queued scancodes to Blitz3D codes
- **`bb_KeyDown(code)`** — pumps SDL events (if `bb_sdl_initialized_`), then checks `bb_sdl_key_down_[sdl_sc]`; returns 0 safely in headless mode
- **`bb_KeyHit(code)`** — edge-triggered; reads `bb_sdl_key_hit_raw_[sdl_sc]` and clears it; pumps events first
- **`bb_GetKey()`** — ensures SDL, pumps, then blocks via `SDL_WaitEvent` + `bb_sdl_process_event_()` until a key is queued; dequeues and translates to Blitz3D code; returns 0 if SDL unavailable
- **`bb_FlushKeys()`** — zeros `bb_sdl_key_down_` and `bb_sdl_key_hit_raw_` arrays, resets queue head/tail, calls `SDL_FlushEvents(KEY_DOWN, KEY_UP)` if SDL is running
- **`bb_sdl.h` extended**:
  - `BB_KEY_QUEUE_CAP = 64` constant
  - `bb_sdl_key_down_[512]`, `bb_sdl_key_hit_raw_[512]` inline bool arrays
  - `bb_key_queue_buf_[64]` circular FIFO of `SDL_Scancode`; `bb_key_queue_head_/tail_`
  - `bb_sdl_process_event_(const SDL_Event&)` — handles QUIT, KEY_DOWN (edge + queue), KEY_UP; called by `bb_PollEvents()` and `bb_WaitKey()`

### Design Note
`bb_KeyDown` / `bb_KeyHit` call `bb_PollEvents()` automatically when SDL is initialized, so game loops like `While Not KeyHit(1) : ... : Wend` work correctly without an explicit event-pump call. In headless mode (SDL not initialized), both functions return 0 immediately — zero overhead, no SDL initialization side-effect.

### Verification (`tests/test_m31_keyboard.bb`)
- `KeyDown(1)` → `0` ✓ (headless, no key pressed)
- `KeyHit(1)` → `0` ✓
- `FlushKeys` → no crash ✓
- `DONE` ✓
- M29 (PeekByte/PokeInt) and M16 (Delete) regression tests recompiled and pass ✓

## v0.1.7 - "SDL3 Infrastructure" (2026-02-23)

### Milestone 30: SDL3 Init + Headless Event Loop

- **`bb_sdl.h` (new file)** — standalone SDL3 header; `bb_runtime.h` includes it
- **`bb_sdl_ensure_()`** — lazy SDL3 initializer (SDL_Init VIDEO+EVENTS); called on first use; guards against double-init
- **`bb_window_` / `bb_renderer_`** — inline globals, both `nullptr` until a graphics milestone creates them
- **`bb_PollEvents()`** — drains SDL event queue; handles `SDL_EVENT_QUIT` by calling `bb_sdl_quit_()` + `std::exit(0)`; placeholder comment for M31 key/mouse state
- **`bb_WaitKey()`** — redesigned for SDL:
  - Non-interactive stdin (piped / test runner) → returns immediately (no SDL, no block)
  - Interactive: calls `bb_sdl_ensure_()`, then `SDL_WaitEvent()` until `KEY_DOWN` or `QUIT`
  - SDL init failure fallback: `std::cin.get()`
- **`bb_sdl_quit_()`** — safely tears down renderer → window → SDL in order; idempotent
- **`bbEnd()` updated** — calls `bb_sdl_quit_()` before exit
- **`bbInit()` updated** — stores `argc/argv`; SDL deferred to first use (text-mode programs pay zero SDL overhead)
- **Compile step** — `SDL3` import lib (`libSDL3.dll.a`) linked automatically when present; `SDL3.dll` copied next to output executable
- **`bb_stdin_is_console_()`** — Windows: `GetFileType(GetStdHandle(STD_INPUT_HANDLE)) == FILE_TYPE_CHAR`; POSIX: `isatty(fileno(stdin))`

### Design Note
SDL3 is initialised **lazily** — text-mode programs (Print, File I/O, Data, etc.) never touch SDL at all. The first call to `bb_WaitKey()`, `bb_PollEvents()`, or a future graphics function triggers `bb_sdl_ensure_()`. This keeps non-graphical programs fast and dependency-free at runtime (no SDL3.dll needed unless the program actually uses it).

### Verification (`tests/test_m30_sdl.bb`)
- `Print "SDL OK"` → `SDL OK` ✓ (headless path: SDL never initialized, zero overhead)
- Binary links SDL3 import library and copies `SDL3.dll` next to exe ✓
- `bbEnd()` / `bb_sdl_quit_()` — no crash on clean exit ✓
- All prior tests (M29 and earlier) still pass ✓

---

## v0.1.6 - "Delete Fix" (2026-02-22)

### Bug Fix: Delete First / Delete Last No Longer Leaks or Corrupts the List

**Root cause**: `visit(DeleteStmt)` only handled the `VarExpr` case via a direct
`varObjectTypes` lookup. Any other expression (`FirstExpr`, `LastExpr`,
`BeforeExpr`, `AfterExpr`) hit the fallback that set the pointer to `nullptr`
but never called `bb_TypeName_Delete()` → memory leak + object remained in the
intrusive linked list (list corruption).

**Fix — `emitter.h`**:
1. `getExprTypeName()` extended with `BeforeExpr`/`AfterExpr` arms (recurse into
   `be->object` / `ae->object` to inherit the object type).
2. `visit(DeleteStmt)` rewritten to call `getExprTypeName()` — type now resolved
   for `VarExpr`, `FirstExpr`, `LastExpr`, `BeforeExpr`, `AfterExpr`.
3. `bb_TypeName_Delete(expr)` emitted directly; pointer passed as-is.
4. Local variable nulled only when object is a `VarExpr`.

**Generated C++ before / after** (`Delete First Node`):
```cpp
// before — fallback, broken:
__bb_Node_head__ = nullptr; // Delete (type unknown)

// after — correct:
bb_Node_Delete(__bb_Node_head__);
```

### Verification (`tests/test_delete.bb`)
- 4 nodes created; count = 4 ✓
- `Delete First Node` → count = 3; new first val = 20 ✓
- `Delete Last Node`  → count = 2; new last val  = 30 ✓
- `Delete b` (VarExpr) → count = 1; only remaining = 30 ✓
- Deletion-safe `For Each` + `Delete n` inside loop → count = 0 ✓

---

## v0.1.5 - "Global Scope Fix" (2026-02-22)

### Bug Fix: Global Variables Now Visible Inside Functions

**Root cause**: `visit(VarDecl)` previously emitted all variable declarations
(Local *and* Global) inside `main()`. User functions are emitted before `main()`,
so any variable declared Global was invisible to them → C++ compile error.

**Fix — two-pass approach in `emitter.h`**:
1. New `collectGlobals()` pass scans the full AST (including function bodies,
   since Blitz3D allows `Global` anywhere) for `VarDecl` nodes with
   `scope == GLOBAL` and emits them at C++ file scope, after type struct
   definitions and before user functions.
2. `visit(VarDecl)` modified: for `GLOBAL` scope, skip the declaration (already
   at file scope) and only emit the initializer assignment in the main body.

**Emit order** (guaranteed by `emit()`):
```
#include "bb_runtime.h"
[type struct + helpers]
[global var declarations]   ← NEW
[user function bodies]
int main(...) {
    [global initializer assignments]
    [main body statements]
}
```

**Parser fix (bonus)**: `Name()` in statement position was crashing. The
statement parser had no paren-call path — it fell into the whitespace-arg loop,
tried to parse `(` as an expression, then choked on `)`.
Fix: added explicit paren-call branch in `parseStatement()` before the
whitespace-arg loop.

### Verification (`tests/test_global.bb`)
- `Greet()` (reads `Global name$`) → `Hello, world!` ✓
- Three `Increment()` calls (mutate `Global counter%`) → `Counter: 3` ✓
- Two `AddScore()` calls (accumulate `Global score#`) → `Score: 4` ✓
- `name = "BlitzNext"` in main + `Greet()` → `Hello, BlitzNext!` ✓

---

## v0.1.4 - "String Transformation" (2026-02-22)

### Milestone 20: String Transformation & Encoding

- **`bb_Upper(s)` / `bb_Lower(s)`** — case conversion via `std::transform` with lambda `(unsigned char c)` to avoid UB on signed char
- **`bb_Trim(s)`** — strips `' '`, `\t`, `\r`, `\n` from both ends
- **`bb_LSet(s, n)`** — left-aligned pad/truncate; **`bb_RSet(s, n)`** — right-aligned pad/truncate
- **`bb_Chr(n)`** → single-char string; **`bb_Asc(s)`** → unsigned ASCII of first char, 0 for empty
- **`bb_Hex(n)`** → uppercase hex, no prefix; negatives treated as unsigned 32-bit
- **`bb_Bin(n)`** → binary string, no leading zeros, minimum `"0"`
- **`bb_String(s, n)`** → repeat string n times

### Verification
- `Upper("Hello World")` → `HELLO WORLD` ✓ / `Lower(...)` → `hello world` ✓
- `Trim("  hello  ")` → `hello` ✓
- `LSet("Hi", 8)` → `Hi      ` ✓ / `RSet("Hi", 8)` → `      Hi` ✓
- `Chr(65)` → `A` ✓ / `Asc("Hello")` → `72` ✓
- `Hex(255)` → `FF` ✓ / `Bin(255)` → `11111111` ✓
- `String("ab", 3)` → `ababab` ✓
- Regressions (M19, M17-M18, all prior tests) pass ✓

---

## v0.1.3 - "String Runtime" (2026-02-22)

### Milestone 19: String Extraction & Search

- **`bb_string.h` (new file)** — standalone string header; `bb_runtime.h` includes it
- **`bbString` typedef** moved from `bb_runtime.h` to `bb_string.h` (its natural home)
- **`bb_Left(s, n)`** — first n characters; **`bb_Right(s, n)`** — last n characters
- **`bb_Mid(s, pos)`** — from 1-based pos to end; **`bb_Mid(s, pos, n)`** — n chars at pos (two overloads)
- **`bb_Instr(s, sub)`** — 1-based index of first match, or 0; **`bb_Instr(s, sub, start)`** — search from pos
- **`bb_Replace(s, from, to)`** — replaces all occurrences (safe against empty `from`)
- **`bb_Str`, `bb_Int(bbString)`, `bb_Float`, `bb_Len`** — moved from `bb_runtime.h`
- **`bb_Str(double)`** — overload changed from `float` to `double` to resolve C++ double-literal ambiguity; `%g` format trims trailing zeros

### Design Note
`bb_string.h` has no dependency on `bb_math.h` or `bb_runtime.h` — self-contained (`<string>`, `<algorithm>`, `<cstdio>` only). Umbrella `bb_runtime.h` includes `bb_string.h` first (provides `bbString`), then `bb_math.h`.

### Verification
- `Print Left("Hello World", 5)` → `Hello` ✓
- `Print Right("Hello World", 5)` → `World` ✓
- `Print Mid("Hello World", 7)` → `World` ✓ / `Mid(..., 7, 3)` → `Wor` ✓
- `Print Instr("Hello World", "World")` → `7` ✓ / `Instr("abcabc","b",3)` → `5` ✓
- `Print Replace("Hello World", "World", "Blitz")` → `Hello Blitz` ✓
- `Print Str(3.14)` → `3.14` ✓ (no trailing zeros via `%g`)
- Regressions (M17 math, M18 random, all prior tests) still pass ✓

---

## v0.1.2 - "Random Numbers" (2026-02-22)

### Milestone 18: Random Number Functions

- **`bb_Rnd()`** — float in [0, 1); **`bb_Rnd(max)`** — float in [0, max); **`bb_Rnd(min, max)`** — float in [min, max)
- **`bb_Rand(max)`** — int in [1, max]; **`bb_Rand(min, max)`** — int in [min, max]
- **`bb_SeedRnd(seed)`** — calls `std::srand(seed)`; stores seed in inline global `__bb_rnd_seed__`
- **`bb_RndSeed()`** — returns `__bb_rnd_seed__` as int
- All overloads live in `bb_math.h`; no parser or emitter changes needed (standard `bb_` call convention)
- `inline` global for seed storage requires C++17 — consistent with rest of project

### Verification
- `SeedRnd 42 : Print RndSeed()` → `42` ✓
- `SeedRnd 1234 : Print RndSeed()` → `1234` ✓
- `Rnd()` → values in [0, 1) (e.g. 0.00186, 0.53167) ✓
- `Rnd(100.0)` → value in [0, 100) ✓
- `Rnd(10.0, 20.0)` → value in [10, 20) ✓
- `Rand(6)` → int in [1, 6] ✓
- `Rand(3, 9)` → int in [3, 9] ✓
- Same seed produces identical sequence (deterministic) ✓

---

## v0.1.1 - "Math Runtime" (2026-02-22)

### Milestone 17: Math Completeness — Trig Inverse & Utility

- **`bb_math.h` (new file)** — standalone math header; `bb_runtime.h` includes it; all math symbols now live in one place
- **`bb_Pi`** — `constexpr float` (3.14159265…); `Pi` as a Blitz3D identifier emits `bb_Pi` via special-case in `Emitter::visit(VarExpr*)`
- **`bb_ASin(x)`** → `asin(x)` in radians → degrees; **`bb_ACos(x)`**, **`bb_ATan(x)`** — same pattern
- **`bb_ATan2(y, x)`** → `atan2(y, x)` → degrees; matches Blitz3D argument order (y first)
- **`bb_Sgn(x)`** → `-1`, `0`, or `1` (sign of x)
- **`bb_Log10(x)`** → base-10 logarithm
- **`bb_Int(float)`** → truncate toward zero (C++ overload alongside existing `bb_Int(bbString)` for string-to-int)
- **Internal helpers** `_bb_d2r()` / `_bb_r2d()` keep trig conversion DRY without polluting global scope
- **`bb_runtime.h` refactored** — math block removed; `#include "bb_math.h"` added; `<cmath>` dependency moved to `bb_math.h`

### Design Note
`Pi` is a Blitz3D built-in constant (used without parentheses). Since the lexer tokenises it as `ID`, it becomes a `VarExpr` in the AST. The Emitter's `visit(VarExpr*)` special-cases `pi` (case-insensitive) → emits `bb_Pi` instead of `var_pi`. No parser changes needed.

### Verification
- `Print Pi` → `3.14159` ✓
- `Print ATan2(1.0, 1.0)` → `45` ✓
- `Print ASin(1.0)` → `90` ✓
- `Print ACos(1.0)` → `0` ✓
- `Print ATan(1.0)` → `45` ✓
- `Print Sgn(-42.5)` → `-1`, `Sgn(0)` → `0`, `Sgn(7.3)` → `1` ✓
- `Print Log10(100.0)` → `2`, `Log10(1000.0)` → `3` ✓
- `Print Int(3.9)` → `3`, `Int(-3.9)` → `-3` ✓
- Regressions (Floor, Ceil, Sqr, Abs, Sin, Cos, Tan, all prior tests) still pass ✓

---

## v0.1.0 - "Type Iteration" (2026-02-22)

### Milestone 16: Type Iteration — First, Last, Before, After, Insert, Each

- **6 new AST nodes** — `FirstExpr`, `LastExpr`, `BeforeExpr`, `AfterExpr`, `InsertStmt`, `ForEachStmt`
- **`ASTVisitor`** — 6 new pure-virtual `visit()` overloads added
- **Parser — `For Each`** — detected at statement level (peek-ahead after `FOR`); dispatched to `parseForEach()` which consumes `FOR EACH var.TypeName ... NEXT`
- **Parser — `Insert`** — `INSERT expr BEFORE/AFTER expr` → `InsertStmt`
- **Parser — `First/Last/Before/After`** — all handled in `parsePrimary()` as expressions; `First TypeName`/`Last TypeName` take a type name token; `Before`/`After` take a sub-expression
- **Emitter — `FirstExpr`** → `__bb_TypeName_head__`
- **Emitter — `LastExpr`** → `__bb_TypeName_tail__`
- **Emitter — `BeforeExpr`** → `(obj)->__prev__`
- **Emitter — `AfterExpr`** → `(obj)->__next__`
- **Emitter — `InsertStmt`** → `bb_TypeName_InsertBefore(obj, tgt)` / `bb_TypeName_InsertAfter(obj, tgt)`; type resolved via `getExprTypeName()` helper (checks `varObjectTypes` map and `FirstExpr`/`LastExpr` nodes)
- **Emitter — `ForEachStmt`** → deletion-safe while-loop: caches `__next__` before body runs; iteration variable auto-registered in `varObjectTypes` for nested field access
- **`emitTypeDecl()`** — now also emits `bb_T_Unlink()`, `bb_T_InsertBefore()`, `bb_T_InsertAfter()` helpers for each Type

### Design Note
`For Each` uses a deletion-safe loop pattern:
```cpp
auto *_fe_cur_p_ = __bb_TypeName_head__;
while (_fe_cur_p_) {
    auto *var_p = _fe_cur_p_;
    _fe_cur_p_ = _fe_cur_p_->__next__;  // cached before body
    // body
}
```
This allows `Delete p` inside the loop body without corrupting iteration, matching Blitz3D's semantics.

### Verification
- `For Each n.Node : Print n\val : Next` → `10  20  30` ✓
- `First Node`, `Last Node` → correct head/tail pointers ✓
- `After First Node`, `Before Last Node` → middle element ✓
- `Insert c Before b` → reordering `10 30 20` ✓
- `Insert a After b` → reordering `30 20 10` ✓
- `Delete b` then `For Each` → skips deleted element safely ✓
- `(First Node)\val`, `(Last Node)\val` → field access on First/Last ✓
- All prior tests (M14/M15 type instances, M12 data) still pass ✓

---

## v0.0.9 - "Type Instances + Field Access" (2026-02-22)

### Milestone 14: Type Instances — New, Delete

- **`NewExpr` AST node** — `typeName`; emits `bb_TypeName_New()`
- **`DeleteStmt` AST node** — `object` expr; emits `bb_TypeName_Delete(var); var = nullptr;`
- **`Local v.TypeName`** — `.TypeName` type annotation parsed in `parseVarDecl()` as `typeHint = ".TypeName"`; emitter maps to `bb_TypeName *var = nullptr;`
- **`emitTypeDecl()`** — emits C++17 struct with field members + intrusive doubly-linked list: `__next__`, `__prev__`, head/tail globals, `bb_T_New()`, `bb_T_Delete()`
- **Emitter** — TypeDecl emitted before function definitions; `typeNames` and `varObjectTypes` maps track types/instances for code-gen; TypeDecl excluded from main body loop

### Milestone 15: Type Field Access (`\` operator)

- **`FieldAccess` AST node** — `object` + `fieldName`; emits `obj->var_field`
- **`FieldAssignStmt` AST node** — `object` + `fieldName` + `value`; emits `obj->var_field = expr;`
- **`parsePostfix()`** — new parsing level between `parsePrimary()` and `parsePower()`; handles chained `\` access (`a\b\c`)
- **Statement context** — `var\field = expr` detected after type-hint consumption in identifier-led branch

### Design Note
Each `Type` declaration generates a standalone C++ struct `bb_T` with intrusive doubly-linked list pointers. `New` allocates and appends to the tail; `Delete` unlinks from the list and frees. This matches Blitz3D's reference semantics and prepares for `First`, `Last`, `Each` iteration (M16).

### Verification
- `Local v.Vec = New Vec : v\x = 10 : v\y = 20 : Print v\x + v\y` → `30` ✓
- Float fields, multiple instances, chained field writes all pass ✓
- `Delete v2` → frees instance, sets pointer to nullptr ✓
- All prior tests still pass ✓

---

## v0.0.8 - "Type Declaration (Struct Parsing)" (2026-02-22)

### Milestone 13: Type Declaration (Struct Parsing)

- **`TypeDecl` AST node** — `name` (string) + `std::vector<Field>` where `Field = {name, typeHint}`
- **`ASTVisitor`** — added `visit(TypeDecl*)` pure virtual
- **Parser** — `TYPE` keyword dispatched to `parseTypeDecl()`; multi-line and colon-separated forms supported; multiple fields per `Field` line (`Field left%, top%, right%, bottom%`); `End Type` and `EndType` both accepted; `TYPE` added to `END` secondary-keyword list
- **Emitter** — `visit(TypeDecl*)` no-op stub; full C++ struct emission deferred to M14

### Design Note
`Field` declarations support one or more comma-separated names on a single line, each with an optional type hint. A `TypeDecl` with no `Field` lines is also valid. The `End Type` terminator can appear on the same line as the last field (colon-separated) or on its own line.

### Verification
- `Type Player : Field x%, y% : End Type` → no crash ✓
- `Type Vec2 : Field dx!, dy! : End Type` → no crash ✓
- `Type Rect : Field left%, top%, right%, bottom% : End Type` → no crash ✓
- `Print "Types parsed OK"` → `Types parsed OK` ✓
- All prior tests still pass ✓

---

## v0.0.7 - "Data / Read / Restore" (2026-02-22)

### Milestone 12: Data, Read, Restore

- **`DataStmt` AST node** — `std::vector<Token> values`; supports signed numeric literals (`-3`, `-1.5`)
- **`ReadStmt` AST node** — `name` + `typeHint`; used by emitter for correct type cast + implicit declaration
- **`RestoreStmt` AST node** — optional `label` field; bare `Restore` resets to index 0
- **Parser** — `DATA`, `READ`, `RESTORE` keywords dispatched; `parseData()` handles signed literals and comma-separated values; `parseRead()` consumes optional type hint; `parseRestore()` accepts plain and dot-label forms
- **Runtime (`bb_runtime.h`)** — `bb_DataVal` tagged struct with `operator int/float/double/bbString()`; inline globals `__bb_data_pool__` + `__bb_data_idx__`; `bb_DataRead()` / `bb_DataRestore(size_t idx=0)`
- **Emitter** — `collectData()` recursive first-pass fills pool before any `Read`; `visit(DataStmt*)` is no-op; `visit(ReadStmt*)` auto-declares undeclared variables (Blitz3D implicit decl); `visit(RestoreStmt*)` emits `bb_DataRestore()`; `declaredVars` set prevents re-declaration

### Design Note
All `Data` statements across the entire program form **one flat sequential pool** — this is correct Blitz3D behaviour. `Read` advances a single pointer through this pool regardless of where the `Data` statement appears in source.

### Verification
- `Data 10,20,30 : Read a : Read b : Print a + b` → `30` ✓
- `Read c : Print c` → `30` (next item in pool) ✓
- `Read s$ : Read t$ : Print s$ + " " + t$` → `Hello World` ✓
- `Restore : Read x : Print x` → `10` (pool reset) ✓
- `Read n% : Read m% : Print n% + m%` → `30` (typed hint) ✓
- All prior tests still pass ✓

---

## v0.0.6 - "Goto / Gosub / Labels" (2026-02-22)

### Milestone 11: Goto, Gosub, Return (Legacy Flow)

- **`LabelStmt` AST node** — stores lowercase label name; handles both `.labelname` and `labelname:` syntax
- **`GotoStmt` AST node** — stores lowercase label name
- **`GosubStmt` AST node** — stores lowercase label name
- **Parser — `:` separator** — `skipNewlines()` now also skips `OPERATOR(":")` tokens; call-arg loop and `parseReturn()` stop at `:`
- **Parser — label detection** — at statement level: `OPERATOR(".")` + ID → dot-label; ID + `OPERATOR(":")` → colon-label
- **Parser — GOTO / GOSUB** — both accept `Goto label` and `Goto .label` forms
- **Emitter — LabelStmt** → `lbl_name:;` (null statement satisfies C++ label grammar)
- **Emitter — GotoStmt** → `goto lbl_name;`
- **Emitter — GosubStmt** → GCC computed-goto trick: `__gosub_ret__ = &&_gosub_ret_N_; goto lbl_X; _gosub_ret_N_:;`
- **Emitter — ReturnStmt** — new `inFunctionBody` flag: bare `Return` in main → `goto *__gosub_ret__`; in function → `return;`

### Verification
- `Goto skip : Print "SKIP" : skip: Print "OK"` → `OK` ✓
- `Goto .done : Print "SKIP2" : .done : Print "OK2"` → `OK2` ✓
- `Gosub greet` / `greet:` / `Return` → `Hello from Gosub` / `Back from Gosub` ✓
- All prior tests (arrays, consts, fixes) still pass ✓

---

## v0.0.5 - "Phase B Language Core" (2026-02-22)

### Milestone 10: Array Indexing

- **`DimStmt` AST node** — `name`, `typeHint`, `dims` (vector of ExprNodes for each dimension)
- **`ArrayAccess` AST node** — `name`, `indices` (vector) for expression-context reads
- **`ArrayAssignStmt` AST node** — `name`, `indices`, `value` for array element writes
- **Parser** — `parseDim()` registers array names in `dimmedArrays` set; disambiguates `name(i)` as `ArrayAccess` vs `CallExpr` in `parsePrimary()`; detects `name(i) = expr` as `ArrayAssignStmt` in statement context
- **Emitter** — `%`→`int`, `#`/`!`→`float`, `$`→`bbString`, no hint→`int`; 1D: `std::vector<T>(n+1)`; multi-dim: nested `std::vector`; Blitz3D size semantics: `Dim a(N)` → indices 0..N → C++ size N+1
- **`bb_runtime.h`** — added `#include <vector>`

### Verification
- `Dim arr%(5) : arr(2) = 42 : Print arr(2)` → `42` ✓
- `Dim scores#(3) : scores(0) = 1.5 : scores(1) = 2.5 : Print scores(0) + scores(1)` → `4` ✓
- `Dim grid%(3,3) : grid(1,1) = 99 : Print grid(1,1)` → `99` ✓
- Array in For loop: `vals(i) = i * 10 : Print vals(3)` → `30` ✓

---

### Milestone 9: Const Declarations

- **`ConstDecl` AST node** — `name`, `typeHint`, `value` (ExprNode)
- **Parser** — `Const name[hint] = expr`; multiple declarations per line via comma separator
- **Emitter** — `%`→`constexpr int`, `#`/`!`→`constexpr float`, no hint→`constexpr auto`, `$`→`const bbString`
- Constants use `var_` prefix for seamless `VarExpr` resolution (no parser changes needed at call sites)

### Verification
- `Const MaxHP% = 100` → `constexpr int var_MaxHP = 100;` ✓
- `Const Pi# = 3.14159` → `constexpr float var_Pi = 3.14159;` ✓
- `Const Greeting$ = "Hello"` → `const bbString var_Greeting = "Hello";` ✓
- `Const A% = 10, B% = 20` → two constexpr declarations ✓
- Full output: `100 / 3.14159 / Hello / 30 / HP is high` ✓

---

## v0.0.4 - "Structured Errors & CLI Parity" (2026-02-22)

### Milestone 7: Structured Error Reporting

- **GCC-compatible error format** — Parser now emits `filename:line:col: error: message` on stderr
- **Unified `error()` method** in `Parser` — replaces three separate `std::cerr` sites (`expect()`, `parseRepeat()`, `parsePrimary()`)
- **Filename propagation** — `parse()` accepts `const std::string& fname`; passed from `blitzcc.cpp` as `cfg.inputPath`
- **Error tracking** — `errorCount` member + `hasErrors()` method; pipeline aborts before emit when parse errors exist
- **Exit codes** — `transpile()` now returns `int`: 0 = success, 1 = parse error, 2 = compile error; `main()` forwards it
- **Compile-step error** also follows structured format: `filename:0:0: error: compilation failed`

### Milestone 8: CLI Parity

- **`-k` flag** — lists all 17 known built-in command names to stdout (one per line)
- **`+k` flag** — lists `name(signature)` per line; usable by IDEal for autocomplete
- **`kCommands[]` table** — static array of `{name, sig}` in `blitzcc.cpp`; single source of truth
- **`BLITZPATH` env var** — `resolvePath()` now checks `$BLITZPATH/rel` as a third fallback after CWD and `../`
- **`-release` flag** — accepted without error, ensures `debug = false` (compatibility with older IDEs that pass `-release`)
- **Version bump** — `-v` and help now report `v0.0.4`

### Verification
- `blitzcc -k` → 17 command names listed ✓
- `blitzcc +k` → `Print(value)`, `Sin(deg#)`, etc. ✓
- `blitzcc -release tests/test_fixes.bb` → exit 0 ✓
- `BLITZPATH=... blitzcc tests/hello.bb` → resolves toolchain via env var ✓
- `tests/bad.bb` → `tests/bad.bb:3:9: error: unexpected token 'THEN'`, exit 1 ✓
- `tests/test_fixes.bb` → `Success: … created.`, exit 0 ✓

## v0.0.3 - "Correctness & IDE Foundation" (2026-02-21)
A correctness overhaul that fixes critical compiler bugs, completes the core language, and lays the foundation for IDE integration.

### Language & Compiler Fixes (13 critical bugs resolved)
- **Assignments** (`x = expr`) now correctly emit `AssignStmt` instead of returning `nullptr`
- **Logical operators** `And`, `Or`, `Xor`, `Not`, `Mod`, `Shl`, `Shr`, `Sar` added to keyword table — were silently dropped before
- **`expect()`** now advances on mismatch; previously caused infinite loops on parse errors
- **`ElseIf` chains** fully implemented via recursive `parseIfTail()`; were fundamentally broken
- **`For...Step -1`** (negative step) fixed with block + ternary condition in emitter
- **Type hint `!`** (float) now correctly emits `float`; was falling through to `auto`
- **Function declarations** (`Function name%(param%)...End Function`) fully implemented with return type hint consumption
- **Preprocessor** `#Include` now resolves paths relative to the including file, not CWD; word boundary check prevents matching `INCLUDEFILES`

### New AST Nodes
- `AssignStmt` — explicit assignment statement
- `FunctionDecl` — user function with typed parameters
- `ReturnStmt` — bare or value-returning return
- `ExitStmt` — loop break
- `EndStmt` — program termination

### Runtime (bb_runtime.h)
- `bb_Print` upgraded to template (any printable type)
- Added: `bb_Input`, `bb_Str`, `bb_Int`, `bb_Float`, `bb_Len`
- Added math: `bb_Sin`, `bb_Cos`, `bb_Tan`, `bb_Sqr`, `bb_Abs`, `bb_Log`, `bb_Exp`, `bb_Floor`, `bb_Ceil`
- Added: `bb_Delay` (Windows/Linux platform-aware)

### Emitter (emitter.h)
- `indentLevel` tracking for properly nested output
- `inExprCtx` flag distinguishes `CallExpr` as statement vs. expression
- `userFunctions` set: first-pass collects declared function names; controls `bb_` prefix
- Operator mapping: `=`→`==`, `<>`→`!=`, `AND`→`&&`, `OR`→`||`, `MOD`→`%`, `SHL`→`<<`, `^`→`std::pow()`

### Cleanup
- Removed `commands.json` and all related scaffolding (`-k`/`+k` flags, `loadCommands()`, `listCommands()`, `nlohmann/json` dependency) — runtime is now the single source of truth for known commands
- `resolvePath()` helper in `blitzcc.cpp` replaces 4× duplicated path logic
- SDL3 linking made conditional on import library presence
- `-std=c++17` flag added to the g++ invocation

### IDE Foundation (Milestone 6)
- `Token` struct already carried `line` and `col` from the lexer
- Added `int line = 0` to `ASTNode` base class
- Parser now stores `token.line` on every constructed node (all statement and expression types)
- Parser errors already show `at line:col`; full IDE-compatible format follows in Milestone 7

### Roadmap
- Expanded from 12 coarse milestones to **70 atomic milestones** across 21 phases — each scoped to a single AI-session context window
- Parity table corrected: `Function`, `Return`, `True`, `False`, `Null`, `Include`, `Xor` operator now marked complete

### Verification
- `tests/test_fixes.bb` → `test_fixes.exe` ✓ (assignments, AND/NOT/OR, ElseIf, For Step -1, float hint, functions, single-line If)
- `tests/bad.bb` → parser errors with correct line numbers, no crash ✓

## v0.0.2 - "The Blitz3D Experience" (2026-02-21)
A major usability update that transforms the transpiler into a seamless build orchestrator.

### Features
- **One-Click Build Automation**: `blitzcc` now automatically invokes the MinGW toolchain.
- **Auto-Deployment**: Required runtime DLLs (like `SDL3.dll`) are automatically copied to the output folder.
- **Smart Output Placement**: Executables are created in the source directory by default, keeping the project root clean.
- **Ultra-Portable Linking**: Refined the linking strategy to bake `winpthread` statically into the executable.
- **Single-DLL Runtime**: Only `SDL3.dll` remains as an external dependency; `libwinpthread-1.dll` is no longer required.
- **Clutter Control**: Intermediate `.cpp` files are automatically cleaned up after successful compilation.

## v0.0.1 - Hello World Milestone (2026-02-21)
The first functional end-to-end transpilation pipeline.

### Milestone 1-5 Completion
- **Toolchain**: Robust `build_windows.bat` for automatic MinGW, CMake, and SDL3 setup.
- **Lexer**: Case-insensitive tokenization with support for keywords, identifiers, and literals.
- **Preprocessor**: Support for `#include` directives with circular inclusion protection.
- **Parser**: 
    - Full operator precedence matching Blitz3D.
    - Variable declarations (`Global`, `Local`, `Dim`) with type hints (#, %, !, $).
    - Control flow structures: `If/Else/EndIf`, `While/Wend`, `Repeat/Until/Forever`, `For/Next`, and `Select/Case`.
- **Emitter**: 
    - AST Visitor-based C++17 code generation.
    - Seamless integration with the local MinGW toolchain.
    - Automatic deployment of required runtime DLLs (`SDL3.dll`, `libstdc++`, etc.).

### Verification
- **Test Case**: `tests/hello.bb` successfully transpiles to `output.exe.cpp` and compiles to a native `hello_world.exe`.
- **Output**: "[DEBUG] blitzcc starting... / Hello from BlitzNext!"
